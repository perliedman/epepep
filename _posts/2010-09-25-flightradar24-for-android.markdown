    it really easy to get to apps.

So, <a href="http://flightradar24.com">Flightradar24</a> finally developed their own Android application. I figured they would do that, and that it would pretty much make <a href="http://per.liedman.net/2010/07/26/what-plane/">What Plane?</a> obsolete. To my surprise, the app they actually released is surprisingly thin, and at least for me personally does not give the information I'm actually interested in.

Ok, they have map, which makes the app look more polished, but apart from that, you only get the aircrafts' callsign and airline; to me, that's the least interesting information. So, I actually still prefer What Plane - no fancy map, just the real information (like destination, point of departure, aircraft model, etc.) on the planes that are actually nearby. Perhaps that's something they'll put in the pay version of their app.

Anyway, go ahead and try the Flightradar24 app, it's not bad, although it solves another information need than the one I tried to cover in What Plane:

(What's the best way to link to an android market app? Is linking the barcode like above the standard way of doing it?)
