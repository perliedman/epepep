  content: Big thumbs up! Although I have bought the FR24 Pro app, I use yours more
    often because of the simplicity, I have very quickly everything I need without
    all the bells and whistles. What would make it a killer app for me - possibility
    to filter (at least by distance and altitude) together with audible notification,
    when there is a new plane in the list. For example when I'm contrailspotting with
    a telescope, I filter just planes above FL240. When I'm near the airport, then
    I filter just planes below 5000 feet and nearer than 3 km. Then I can use free
    time to drink without missing interesting pieces of machinery! But anyway thanks
    for the app even as it is!

  content: ! "That's great to hear!\r\n\r\nI certainly won't promise I'll implement
    those things, but it's great suggestions, and I'll keep them in mind when&#47;if
    I get around to do some more development.\r\n\r\n(And in case you or anyone else
    is interested, I wouldn't mind opening up the source for others.)"

I'm still alive even if posts here are even less frequent than usual.

<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.liedman.net&#47;share&#47;WhatPlane-android-1.1.1.apk">What Plane? version 1.1.1<&#47;a> is now available for download. It has a lot of bug fixes, adds a small needle pointing the direction of the plane (if your compass works, mine never does on my HTC Desire), and also adds an application icon. I have more fun with this version than is really healthy.
